##Introduction

Traditionally many griiish people spend their annual summer holiday overseas. however, following the
recent economic downturn many British holidaymakers are looking for cheaper holidays and choosing
to take their summer break within the UK. 
One of the cheapest types of holiday is camping. Once you have purchased the basic equipment (tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment etc.) there are many campsites throughout the UK that allow you to pitch a tent and stay for several days for comparatively little cost. 

Many of these campsites provide facilities such as toilets, showers and even small shops and cafe's.

Getting away from technology, cooking outdoors and taking part in outdoor activities can make camping a refreshing and enjoyable holiday, especially for families 

**Scenario**

Keen to capitalise on a renewed interest in camping a UK camping organisation has approached you to
develop a website that will promote camping as an enjoyable, fun holiday. 

The site will be aimed specifically at people with little or no prior experience of camping. It witl serye as a guide to get people started with camping and provide advice and recommendations forplaces to camp in the UK. The website will need to provide the following features:

* A page from which it is possible to navigate to the other resources in the website. The home page
will need to quickly communicate the purpose of the site, be visually engaging and provide clear
navigation to the rest of the site. This page must feature an enticing, good quality image of a campsite.

* A page that describes different types oftent and offers advice on choosing a tent

* A page that lists essential camping equipment such as clothing, sleeping bags and torches.

* A page that provides information on campsite cooking and camping food.

* A page that describes camping related activities. Campsites are usually located in the countryside and
provide easy access to a range of outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing and bird watching. This part
of the website should provide an overview of the kind of activities that cal.rbe enjoyed when camping.

* A series of pages that describe different areas of the UK that are good for
camping e.g. the Peak District. Each page should feature the following:

1. A map showing the area.

2. A good quality photograph of the area.

3. A list of available campsites within the area.

4. General information on activities and attractions in the area.

5. In the future many additional pages will be added to website so think carefully about the structure and
,navigation in this section of the site.

6. A'Camping Advice' forum. Here users willbe able to post questions about camping and campsites.
The questions will be answered by fellow users and experts. Users will have to register with the website
before making a contribution to the forum. A website administrator will need a way to delete old or
inappropriate messages.
