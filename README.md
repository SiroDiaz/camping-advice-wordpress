##Introduction

Traditionally many british people spend their annual summer holiday overseas. However, following the
recent economic downturn many British holidaymakers are looking for cheaper holidays and choosing
to take their summer break within the UK. 
One of the cheapest types of holiday is camping. Once you have purchased the basic equipment (tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment etc.) there are many campsites throughout the UK that allow you to pitch a tent and stay for several days for comparatively little cost. 

Many of these campsites provide facilities such as toilets, showers and even small shops and cafe's.

Getting away from technology, cooking outdoors and taking part in outdoor activities can make camping a refreshing and enjoyable holiday, especially for families 

**Scenario**

Keen to capitalise on a renewed interest in camping a UK camping organisation has approached you to develop a website that will promote camping as an enjoyable, fun holiday. 

The site will be aimed specifically at people with little or no prior experience of camping.

It will serve as a guide to get people started with camping and provide advice and recommendations for places to camp in the UK. The website will need to provide the following features:

* A page from which it is possible to navigate to the other resources in the website. The home page will need to quickly communicate the purpose of the site, be visually engaging and provide clear navigation to the rest of the site. This page must feature an enticing, good quality image of a campsite.

* A page that describes different types of tents and offers advice on choosing a tent.

* A page that lists essential camping equipment such as clothing, sleeping bags and torches.

* A page that provides information on campsite cooking and camping food.

* A page that describes camping related activities. Campsites are usually located in the countryside and provide easy access to a range of outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing and bird watching. This part of the website should provide an overview of the kind of activities that can be enjoyed when camping.

* A series of pages that describe different areas of the UK that are good for camping e.g. the Peak District. Each page should feature the following:
_A map showing the area._
_A good quality photograph of the area._
_A list of available campsites within the area._
_General information on activities and attractions in the area._

In the future many additional pages will be added to website so think carefully about the structure and navigation in this section of the site.

*A'Camping Advice' forum. Here users will be able to post questions about camping and campsites.
The questions will be answered by fellow users and experts. Users will have to register with the website before making a contribution to the forum. A website administrator will need a way to delete old or inappropriate messages.
